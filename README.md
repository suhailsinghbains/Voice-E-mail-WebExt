# Voice-E-mail-WebExt

The aim of our project is to develop a voice-based email system that will facilitate visually challenged individuals to access email in a problem-free manner. This system along with providing mail services with efficacy and simplicity will also eliminate the mind-numbing task of settling and sorting characters using standard Braille keyboards. The system is serviceable not only for visually impaired but also for illiterate people.

The primary key aspect which will be put under consideration is that the users of this system do not have any basic information regarding the keyboard shortcuts used or wherever the keys are used for. All functions to be utilized in this system are supposed to be simple mouse click operations creating the system very userfriendly. This system provides a voice-based mailing service which furnishes them to browse and send mail on their own, without any guidance. The users ought to use certain keywords that can perform certain actions e.g. Read, Send, Compose Mail, etc. This EMAIL system is utilized by a visually challenged person to access mails facility and with efficacy. Therefore dependence of visually challenged on others for his or her activities associated with mail is often reduced.
